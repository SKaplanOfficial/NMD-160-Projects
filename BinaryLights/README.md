# Assignment 2 - Moving Lights

This project requires the Minim and PostFX libraries for Processing.

The project was designed based off of the class example of a "light" moving across the screen continuously. I knew that I wanted to take an object-oriented approach from the start, but apart from that all other changes were unplanned and happened as I let myself explore my creativity.

The strings of 0s and 1s replace the colored line of the "lights", but still behave in much the same way. I changed the look to create the feeling of being immersed in a cyber realm -- the PostFX filters and the music add to this (At least for me!).

Click anywhere to add one "light" object. Press R to generate 50 randomly placed ones.

I've switched to Minim for this project to avoid some issues I had with Processing sound, but on my Macbook Air I am now getting an OpenGL error. The program works fine despite this error, but it is something I'd like to fix (if possible) in the future.
