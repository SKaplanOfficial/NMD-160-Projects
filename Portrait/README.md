# Self Portrait
## By Stephen Kaplan

This project requires the Processing Sound library. 

Left click to generate squares at your mouse's position. These squares, all set at random rotations and a variety of colors, then travel to their predetermined location, in the end creating a coherant image of my face (albeit a stylized pixel version).

Right click to change the hair color. This represents my desire to explore new styles and experiences.

Move the mouse to change the portait's background color.

This project was inspired by [Jacob Joaquin's](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/409770) sketch on [OpenProcessing.org](https://www.openprocessing.org).
