This project requires PostFX, RiTa, and toxiclibs libraries for Processing.

PostFX and RiTa can both be downloaded from Sketch>Import Library>Add Library>Search for their names and download/install.

Toxiclibs can be downloaded here: https://bitbucket.org/postspectacular/toxiclibs/downloads/

Motivation -
My motivation for this project came from the desire to give people a unique way to experience programming. While I'm not sure if people outside this class will ever see my creation, and in addition to that it definitely needs improvement before then, the idea that someone who is unfamiliar with programming could feel the sense of creating something unique to them via my project is very interesting to me.

Interaction - 
After running the program, click on the "Click to begin" button. Enter the information asked and follow the on-screen instructions. Make note of the different "challenges" that you must overcome, such as specific timing requirements for some entries.

The result screen will inform which parts of the generated program your entered values went toward.

Note that some values are cumulative, meaning that the only way to reset them is to fully exit out of the program.
